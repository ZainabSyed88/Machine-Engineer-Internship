**Market Segmentation of Electronic Vehicles in India**

**Overview**
This project focuses on segmenting customers in the Indian Electronic Vehicle (EV) market using clustering techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments and map them to the Technology Adoption Life Cycle (TALC) for targeted marketing strategies.

**Key Objectives**

Understand customer attributes influencing EV adoption.
Identify distinct customer clusters based on demographic and economic features.
Map the clusters to the TALC framework for strategic marketing.
Provide actionable insights for businesses to enhance EV adoption.
Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project contains the following attributes:

**Age:** Age of the customer.
**Profession:** Occupation of the customer.
**Marital Status: **Marital status (Married/Single).
**Car Loan:** Status of car loan requirement.
**No of Dependents:** Number of dependents the customer has.
**Total Salary: **Total annual income.
**EV Price: **Price of the EV considered/purchased.
Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing and duplicate values.
Renamed columns for clarity.
Converted necessary categorical data into numerical formats for clustering.
Data Exploration and Visualization

Explored age distribution, profession-wise customer count, and car loan status by marital status.
Visualized relationships between salary, age, dependents, and EV price using scatter and 3D plots.
Clustering with K-Prototypes

Used K-Prototypes for clustering mixed data types.
Determined optimal number of clusters using cost analysis.
Achieved two clusters:
**Cluster 0:** Early Adopters
**Cluster 1:** Early Majority
Mapping Clusters to TALC

Mapped clusters to the Technology Adoption Life Cycle to better understand customer segments.
Evaluation

Computed a Silhouette Score of 0.55, indicating a moderately good clustering result.
**Insights**
**Cluster 0 (Early Adopters):**
Younger, tech-savvy, and environmentally conscious customers.
Higher willingness to pay a premium for new EV technology.
**Cluster 1 (Early Majority):**
Middle-aged, middle-income customers.
More price-sensitive and require evidence of product benefits before adoption.
**Visualizations**
Age distribution, marital status analysis, and car loan requirements.
Influence of EV price on salary, age, and number of dependents using scatter and 3D plots.
Pie chart representing customer segments mapped to the TALC framework.
Conclusion
The analysis identifies two distinct customer segments with unique characteristics. These insights can guide EV manufacturers and marketers to:

Target Early Adopters with premium offerings and innovative features.
Appeal to the Early Majority with value-based messaging and cost-effective options.
